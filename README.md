Design: 
* Time-based, single player game with multiple "shadows" of your snake.
* Start with 3 shadows (Lengths: 1, 3, 5)
* You are presented Start and End points on the grid (+possibly timed rounds or timed overall round)
* Grid is a 10x10 rectangular grid (+expand to differently shaped grids)
* You hit the wall you die. You hit your previous shadow, you die. You hit a dead body of a previous shadow, you die. 
* When you die, the dead body remains on the grid in the place and configuration that you were in. 
* Goal: get as many snakes to the end without dying.
